My Most favourite chocolate cake 
choco chips and the chocolate flavour added on the cake makes its tasty and yummy
the batter which needs flour and milk to make it smooth
bake the batter to get a ine shape in the oven
add the cream or sugar syrup to it
add some choco chips on top to make it look tasty
then have a bite and serve it !!
